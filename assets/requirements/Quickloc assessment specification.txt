Good day

Thank you for showing interest in the Quickloc8 Front-End developer position that was advertised on LinkedIn

To progress to the next stage please complete the coding challenge.

You are required to develop a VueJs/Flutter application. (Preferably Flutter)

When the application loads, it must display a splash screen with the Quicklc8 Logo displayed (Quicloc8-logo.png).

The splash screen must display for 3.5 seconds.

After the splash screen, a map showing taxi icons at specified locations facing the correct direction must appear

The Locations and directions are in the file vehicleCoordinates.json. See vehicleLocations.png for an example of how the map with locations should look.

You can use google maps API or mapbox (https://mapbox.com)  to display the map. Ensure appropriate zooming. 

There must be a link that redirects users to the messages screen. The messages to be displayed are in messages.json. The message screen must look like the example in messages.png

Use material design, and the application should be responsive and viewable in different screen sizes.

Bonus Question 1 : The splash screen can show a pulsating logo using the quickloc8.svg file.

Bonus Question 2.
Given the following location and coverage ranges (in meters) of three cellphone towers

1. Latitude : longitude: '28.201021',     latitude: '-25.757999',range: 1000
2. longitude: '28.201217651367', latitude: '-25.75813293457',  range: 1000
3. longitude: '28.201139', latitude: '-25.757912', range: '5607'

Calculate the approximate position of person using a cellphone in an area covered by the above cellphone towers.

All files necessary for this challenge are attached.
